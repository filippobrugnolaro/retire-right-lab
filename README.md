# üè¶ Retire Right Lab - Italian Pension Fund Calculator

A comprehensive **Next.js** pension fund calculator specifically designed for the Italian market. This tool simulates pension fund investments, TFR (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto), ETF reinvestments and personal investments with accurate Italian tax calculations.

## üìä What This Calculator Does

This calculator provides detailed projections for retirement planning in Italy, comparing different investment strategies:

-   **Pension Fund (Fondo Pensione)** with TFR conversion
-   **Company TFR** traditional accumulation
-   **ETF Reinvestment** of tax deductions
-   **Personal Investment** alternative

## üßÆ Complete Calculation Methodology

### 1. üìà Monthly Compound Interest Calculations

#### 1.1 Pension Fund with TFR Timing

The pension fund calculation uses **monthly compounding** with special handling for TFR (13-month salary structure):

```typescript
function calculatePensionFundMonthlyCompound(
    currentAccumulated: number,
    yearlyContribution: number,
    yearlyTfr: number,
    annualRate: number
): number {
    const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
    const monthlyContribution = yearlyContribution / 12;
    const monthlyTfrPortion = yearlyTfr / 13; // TFR divided by 13 months

    let accumulated = currentAccumulated;

    // Months 1-11: Regular contributions + monthly TFR portion
    for (let month = 0; month < 11; month++) {
        accumulated =
            accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) +
            monthlyContribution +
            monthlyTfrPortion;
    }

    // Month 12: Regular contribution + DOUBLE TFR portion (12th + 13th month paid together)
    accumulated =
        accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) +
        monthlyContribution +
        2 * monthlyTfrPortion;

    return accumulated;
}
```

**Key Points:**

-   **Regular contributions** (investment + employer + worker): divided by 12 months
-   **TFR**: divided by 13 months, but 12th and 13th portions paid together in December
-   **Monthly formula**: `A(t+1) = A(t) √ó (1 + r/12) + monthly_contribution + tfr_portion`

**Why This Matters:**
This reflects real-world Italian salary structure where employees receive:

-   12 regular monthly salaries
-   1 additional "13th month" salary in December (Christmas bonus)
-   TFR is calculated on all 13 months, but the December payment includes both regular and bonus salary TFR portions

#### 1.2 ETF and Personal Investment Compounding

Standard monthly compounding for ETF and personal investments:

```typescript
function calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    currentAccumulated: number,
    yearlyContribution: number,
    annualRate: number
): number {
    const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
    const monthlyContribution = yearlyContribution / 12;

    let accumulated = currentAccumulated;

    for (let month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        accumulated = accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) + monthlyContribution;
    }

    return accumulated;
}
```

**Formula**: `A(t+1) = A(t) √ó (1 + r/12) + contribution/12`

### 2. üí∞ Contribution Calculations

#### 2.1 Annual Contributions

The calculator computes four main types of contributions each year:

```typescript
// Employer contribution (only if TFR is calculated)
const employerContribution = params.calculateTfr
    ? currentIncome * (params.employerContribution / 100)
    : 0;

// TFR calculation (7.41% of gross salary)
const tfr = params.calculateTfr ? currentIncome * 0.0741 : 0;

// Member/worker contribution (only if TFR is calculated)
const memberContribution = params.calculateTfr
    ? currentIncome * (params.memberContribution / 100)
    : 0;

// Additional investment (user-defined)
const currentInvestment = params.investment; // Updated yearly based on increases
```

**Detailed Breakdown:**

1. **Employer Contribution** (`employerContribution`):

    - Percentage of gross salary paid by the company (typically 1-3%)
    - Only applies when TFR is redirected to pension fund
    - Example: 2% of ‚Ç¨35,000 = ‚Ç¨700/year

2. **TFR (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto)** (`tfr`):

    - Fixed at 7.41% of gross annual salary (Italian law)
    - Normally stays in company, but can be redirected to pension fund
    - Calculated on 13 months of salary (including Christmas bonus)
    - Example: 7.41% of ‚Ç¨35,000 = ‚Ç¨2,593.50/year

3. **Member Contribution** (`memberContribution`):

    - Employee's personal contribution (typically 1-2% of salary)
    - Only when participating in pension fund with TFR
    - Gets tax deduction benefits
    - Example: 1.3% of ‚Ç¨35,000 = ‚Ç¨455/year

4. **Additional Investment** (`currentInvestment`):
    - Extra voluntary contribution set by user
    - Can be any amount (subject to tax deduction limits)
    - Also gets tax deduction benefits
    - Example: ‚Ç¨3,000/year (user choice)

#### 2.2 Income and Investment Growth

The calculator models realistic career progression with periodic increases:

```typescript
// Income increases
if (year > 1 && (year - 1) % params.incomeIncrease.frequency === 0) {
    if (params.incomeIncrease.isPercentage) {
        currentIncome *= 1 + params.incomeIncrease.amount / 100;
    } else {
        currentIncome += params.incomeIncrease.amount;
    }
}

// Investment increases (can be negative for inflation adjustments)
if (year > 1 && (year - 1) % params.investmentIncrease.frequency === 0) {
    if (params.investmentIncrease.isPercentage) {
        currentInvestment *= 1 + params.investmentIncrease.amount / 100;
    } else {
        currentInvestment += params.investmentIncrease.amount;
    }
}
```

**How Growth Works - Step by Step:**

1. **Timing Check**: `(year - 1) % params.frequency === 0`

    - Checks if it's time for an increase based on frequency
    - Example: frequency=2 means every 2 years (years 3, 5, 7...)

2. **Income Growth Types**:

    - **Percentage**: Compound growth (e.g., 3% annually)
        - Year 1: ‚Ç¨35,000
        - Year 2: ‚Ç¨35,000 √ó 1.03 = ‚Ç¨36,050
        - Year 3: ‚Ç¨36,050 √ó 1.03 = ‚Ç¨37,132
    - **Fixed Amount**: Linear growth (e.g., +‚Ç¨1,000 annually)
        - Year 1: ‚Ç¨35,000
        - Year 2: ‚Ç¨35,000 + ‚Ç¨1,000 = ‚Ç¨36,000
        - Year 3: ‚Ç¨36,000 + ‚Ç¨1,000 = ‚Ç¨37,000

3. **Investment Adjustments**:
    - Can be **positive** (increasing contributions over time)
    - Can be **negative** (reducing contributions, e.g., -2% for inflation adjustment)
    - Allows modeling changing financial capacity over career

**Real-World Example**:

-   Starting salary: ‚Ç¨35,000
-   Income increase: +2% every year
-   Investment: ‚Ç¨3,000 initially, -1% every 2 years (inflation adjustment)
-   Result: Income grows with career, investment adjusts for purchasing power

### 3. üè¶ Tax Calculations

#### 3.1 Fiscal Relaxation (Detrazione Fiscale)

Tax deductions available on personal contributions with income-based brackets:

```typescript
function calculateFiscalRelaxation(
    amount: number,
    previousYearIncome: number
): number {
    let relaxation = 0;
    let remainingAmount = Math.min(amount, 5164.57); // Maximum eligible amount

    if (previousYearIncome > 50000) {
        // 43% rate for income > ‚Ç¨50,000
        const availableAtHighest = previousYearIncome - 50000;
        const amountAtHighest = Math.min(remainingAmount, availableAtHighest);
        relaxation += amountAtHighest * 0.43;
        remainingAmount -= amountAtHighest;

        // 35% rate for ‚Ç¨28,000-‚Ç¨50,000 bracket
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            const amountAtMiddle = Math.min(remainingAmount, 22000);
            relaxation += amountAtMiddle * 0.35;
            remainingAmount -= amountAtMiddle;
        }

        // 23% rate for ‚Ç¨0-‚Ç¨28,000 bracket
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            relaxation += remainingAmount * 0.23;
        }
    } else if (previousYearIncome > 28000) {
        // 35% rate for ‚Ç¨28,000-‚Ç¨50,000
        const availableAtHighest = previousYearIncome - 28000;
        const amountAtHighest = Math.min(remainingAmount, availableAtHighest);
        relaxation += amountAtHighest * 0.35;
        remainingAmount -= amountAtHighest;

        // 23% rate for remaining
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            relaxation += remainingAmount * 0.23;
        }
    } else {
        // 23% rate for income ‚â§ ‚Ç¨28,000
        relaxation = remainingAmount * 0.23;
    }

    return relaxation;
}
```

**How This Works - Step by Step:**

1. **Income Qualification**: The function uses PREVIOUS year's income to determine which tax brackets you qualify for
2. **Top-Down Application**: Tax deductions are applied starting from the highest bracket you qualify for
3. **Bracket Limits**: Each bracket has a maximum amount that can be deducted at that rate

**Example**: Person with ‚Ç¨45,000 income contributing ‚Ç¨4,000:

-   Qualifies for 35% bracket (income > ‚Ç¨28,000 but < ‚Ç¨50,000)
-   ‚Ç¨4,000 eligible contribution gets 35% deduction = ‚Ç¨1,400 tax savings
-   If income was ‚Ç¨55,000, they'd get 43% on the first portion, then 35% on remaining

**Why Previous Year Income?**: Italian tax law requires using prior year income for pension contribution deductions

**Tax Brackets:**

-   **23%**: Income ‚Ç¨0 - ‚Ç¨28,000
-   **35%**: Income ‚Ç¨28,001 - ‚Ç¨50,000
-   **43%**: Income > ‚Ç¨50,000

**Important**: Maximum eligible amount for deductions: **‚Ç¨5,164.57**

#### 3.2 Pension Fund Taxation

Progressive taxation based on years of participation:

```typescript
const calculateTaxRate = (years: number): number => {
    if (years <= 15) return 15; // 15% for first 15 years
    if (years >= 35) return 9; // 9% minimum after 35 years
    return 15 - (years - 15) * 0.3; // Decreases 0.3% per year from year 16-35
};
```

**Tax Formula**: `Tax = 15% - 0.3% √ó (years - 15)` for years 16-35

#### 3.3 TFR Taxation

TFR taxation uses proportional taxation based on average of last 5 years:

```typescript
function calculateTfrTaxationRate(
    yearlyResults: YearlyResult[],
    currentYear: number,
    currentIncome: number
): number {
    let totalProportionalTaxation = 0;
    const yearsToConsider = Math.min(currentYear, 5);

    // Calculate proportional tax for each year based on income
    // Then average over the years considered

    return totalProportionalTaxation / yearsToConsider;
}
```

**How TFR Taxation Works - Detailed Explanation:**

1. **5-Year Average Rule**: Italian law requires averaging tax rates over the last 5 years of work
2. **Proportional Calculation**: For each year, calculate what percentage of income falls in each tax bracket
3. **Weighted Average**: The final rate is the average of all proportional rates

**Proportional Tax Calculation Process**:

```typescript
// For each income level, calculate weighted average of tax brackets
if (income <= 28000) {
    proportionalTaxation = 23; // All income in 23% bracket
} else if (income <= 50000) {
    const bracket1Amount = 28000;
    const bracket2Amount = income - 28000;
    proportionalTaxation =
        (bracket1Amount / income) * 23 + (bracket2Amount / income) * 35;
} else {
    const bracket1Amount = 28000; // First ‚Ç¨28,000 at 23%
    const bracket2Amount = 22000; // Next ‚Ç¨22,000 at 35% (‚Ç¨28k-‚Ç¨50k)
    const bracket3Amount = income - 50000; // Remainder at 43%
    proportionalTaxation =
        (bracket1Amount / income) * 23 +
        (bracket2Amount / income) * 35 +
        (bracket3Amount / income) * 43;
}
```

**Example - ‚Ç¨45,000 Income**:

-   ‚Ç¨28,000 taxed at 23% = portion weight: 28000/45000 = 62.2%
-   ‚Ç¨17,000 taxed at 35% = portion weight: 17000/45000 = 37.8%
-   Proportional rate = (62.2% √ó 23%) + (37.8% √ó 35%) = 14.3% + 13.2% = **27.5%**

**Why This Method?**:

-   Prevents tax jumps when crossing bracket thresholds
-   Provides fairer taxation based on career-average income
-   Reflects Italian TFR tax law accurately

### 4. üè¢ TFR Company Calculation

TFR accumulation in company with annual revaluation:

```typescript
// TFR revaluation rate: 1.5% fixed + 75% of inflation
const tfrRevaluationRate = 1.5 + 0.75 * params.inflation;

// Annual TFR accumulation with revaluation
tfrGrossAccumulated =
    tfrGrossAccumulated * (1 + tfrRevaluationRate / 100) +
    tfr * (1 + tfrRevaluationRate / 100);

// Apply taxation
const tfrNetValue = tfrGrossAccumulated * (1 - tfrTaxationRate / 100);
```

**Formula**: `TFR(t+1) = TFR(t) √ó (1 + revaluation_rate) + current_year_tfr √ó (1 + revaluation_rate)`

### 5. üìä ETF Reinvestment Strategy

ETF reinvestment uses tax savings from fiscal relaxation:

```typescript
// ETF investment equals total fiscal relaxation
const etfInvestment = params.etfReinvestment.enabled
    ? totalFiscalRelaxation
    : 0;

// Calculate ETF accumulation with monthly compounding
etfAccumulatedValue = calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    etfAccumulatedValue,
    etfInvestment,
    params.etfReinvestment.annualReturn
);

// Tax only on gains (not contributions)
const etfGains = Math.max(0, etfAccumulatedValue - totalEtfContributions);
const etfTaxOnGains = etfGains * (params.etfReinvestment.taxRate / 100);
const etfNetAccumulatedValue = etfAccumulatedValue - etfTaxOnGains;
```

### 6. üéØ Personal Investment Alternative

Personal investment after IRPEF taxation:

```typescript
// Total personal contributions subject to IRPEF
const totalPersonalContributions = memberContribution + currentInvestment;

// Calculate IRPEF tax on contributions
const irpefTaxOnPersonalContributions = calculateIrpefTax(
    totalPersonalContributions,
    currentIncome
);

// Net investment amount after IRPEF
const personalInvestmentAmount =
    totalPersonalContributions - irpefTaxOnPersonalContributions;

// Calculate accumulation, then tax only gains
personalAccumulatedValue = calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    personalAccumulatedValue,
    personalInvestmentAmount,
    params.personalInvestment.annualReturn
);

// Tax only on gains (capital gains tax)
const totalGains = Math.max(
    0,
    personalAccumulatedValue - totalPersonalInvestments
);
const totalTaxOnGains = totalGains * (params.personalInvestment.taxRate / 100);
personalNetAccumulatedValue = personalAccumulatedValue - totalTaxOnGains;
```

### 7. üíπ Inflation Adjustment (Real Values)

All calculations include inflation-adjusted "real values":

```typescript
// Real value calculation
const realValue = nominalValue / Math.pow(1 + params.inflation / 100, year);

// Net real value (after tax and inflation)
const netRealValue = netValue / Math.pow(1 + params.inflation / 100, year);
```

**Formula**: `Real Value = Nominal Value / (1 + inflation)^years`

### 8. üìà Return Calculations

#### Annualized Returns

```typescript
// Gross annualized return
const annualizedReturn =
    Math.pow(finalValue / totalContributions, 1 / params.duration) - 1;

// Net annualized return (after taxes)
const netAnnualizedReturn =
    Math.pow(netFinalValue / totalContributions, 1 / params.duration) - 1;
```

**Formula**: `Annualized Return = (Final Value / Initial Investment)^(1/years) - 1`

## üîç Key Features & Assumptions

### Monthly vs Annual Contributions

-   **Pension Fund**: Monthly contributions with special TFR timing (13-month structure)
-   **ETF/Personal**: Standard 12-month equal contributions
-   **Compounding**: Applied monthly for more accurate projections

### Tax Timing

-   **Fiscal Relaxation**: Applied in year N+1 based on year N contributions and income
-   **Pension Fund Tax**: Applied at withdrawal (simulated annually)
-   **ETF/Personal Tax**: Only on gains, not contributions

### Italian Specifics

-   **TFR Rate**: 7.41% of gross salary
-   **TFR Revaluation**: 1.5% + 75% of inflation
-   **13th Month**: Paid in December with regular December salary
-   **Tax Brackets**: Accurate Italian IRPEF brackets (23%, 35%, 43%)

-   35-year pension fund projection with monthly compounding

## üíº Detailed Salary Examples

Here are three comprehensive examples showing how different income levels work in the Italian pension system:

### Example 1: ‚Ç¨25,000 Gross Salary (Entry Level)

**Basic Setup:**

```typescript
const params = {
    annualIncome: 25000,
    investment: 2000, // Additional contribution
    employerContribution: 2.0, // 2%
    memberContribution: 1.3, // 1.3%
    calculateTfr: true,
};
```

**Annual Contributions:**

-   **TFR**: ‚Ç¨25,000 √ó 7.41% = **‚Ç¨1,852.50**
-   **Employer**: ‚Ç¨25,000 √ó 2% = **‚Ç¨500**
-   **Member**: ‚Ç¨25,000 √ó 1.3% = **‚Ç¨325**
-   **Investment**: **‚Ç¨2,000** (user choice)
-   **Total Personal** (Member + Investment): ‚Ç¨325 + ‚Ç¨2,000 = **‚Ç¨2,325**

**Tax Benefits (Fiscal Relaxation):**

-   Previous year income: ‚Ç¨25,000 (‚â§ ‚Ç¨28,000)
-   Tax bracket: **23%**
-   Eligible amount: ‚Ç¨2,325 (under ‚Ç¨5,164.57 limit)
-   **Tax savings: ‚Ç¨2,325 √ó 23% = ‚Ç¨534.75**

**TFR Taxation:**

-   Proportional rate: **23%** (all income in lowest bracket)
-   5-year average: 23% (assuming stable income)

**Monthly Pension Fund Deposits:**

-   Regular contributions: (‚Ç¨500 + ‚Ç¨325 + ‚Ç¨2,000) √∑ 12 = **‚Ç¨235.42/month**
-   TFR: ‚Ç¨1,852.50 √∑ 13 = **‚Ç¨142.50/month** (months 1-11)
-   December: ‚Ç¨235.42 + (2 √ó ‚Ç¨142.50) = **‚Ç¨520.42** (double TFR)

---

### Example 2: ‚Ç¨33,000 Gross Salary (Mid-Level)

**Basic Setup:**

```typescript
const params = {
    annualIncome: 33000,
    investment: 3000,
    employerContribution: 2.0,
    memberContribution: 1.3,
    calculateTfr: true,
};
```

**Annual Contributions:**

-   **TFR**: ‚Ç¨33,000 √ó 7.41% = **‚Ç¨2,445.30**
-   **Employer**: ‚Ç¨33,000 √ó 2% = **‚Ç¨660**
-   **Member**: ‚Ç¨33,000 √ó 1.3% = **‚Ç¨429**
-   **Investment**: **‚Ç¨3,000**
-   **Total Personal**: ‚Ç¨429 + ‚Ç¨3,000 = **‚Ç¨3,429**

**Tax Benefits (Fiscal Relaxation):**

-   Previous year income: ‚Ç¨33,000 (> ‚Ç¨28,000, < ‚Ç¨50,000)
-   Available at 35% bracket: ‚Ç¨33,000 - ‚Ç¨28,000 = **‚Ç¨5,000**
-   Eligible contribution: ‚Ç¨3,429 (all qualifies for 35%)
-   **Tax savings: ‚Ç¨3,429 √ó 35% = ‚Ç¨1,200.15**

**TFR Taxation (Proportional):**

-   Income ‚Ç¨33,000 breakdown:
    -   ‚Ç¨28,000 at 23% = (28,000/33,000) √ó 23% = **19.5%**
    -   ‚Ç¨5,000 at 35% = (5,000/33,000) √ó 35% = **5.3%**
-   **Proportional rate: 19.5% + 5.3% = 24.8%**

**Monthly Pension Fund Deposits:**

-   Regular contributions: (‚Ç¨660 + ‚Ç¨429 + ‚Ç¨3,000) √∑ 12 = **‚Ç¨340.75/month**
-   TFR: ‚Ç¨2,445.30 √∑ 13 = **‚Ç¨188.10/month** (months 1-11)
-   December: ‚Ç¨340.75 + (2 √ó ‚Ç¨188.10) = **‚Ç¨716.95** (double TFR)

---

### Example 3: ‚Ç¨53,000 Gross Salary (Senior Level)

**Basic Setup:**

```typescript
const params = {
    annualIncome: 53000,
    investment: 4000,
    employerContribution: 2.5, // Higher employer contribution
    memberContribution: 1.5,
    calculateTfr: true,
};

**Annual Contributions:**

-   **TFR**: ‚Ç¨53,000 √ó 7.41% = **‚Ç¨3,927.30**
-   **Employer**: ‚Ç¨53,000 √ó 2.5% = **‚Ç¨1,325**
-   **Member**: ‚Ç¨53,000 √ó 1.5% = **‚Ç¨795**
-   **Investment**: **‚Ç¨4,000**
-   **Total Personal**: ‚Ç¨795 + ‚Ç¨4,000 = **‚Ç¨4,795**

**Tax Benefits (Fiscal Relaxation) - Complex Calculation:**

-   Previous year income: ‚Ç¨53,000 (> ‚Ç¨50,000)
-   Available at 43% bracket: ‚Ç¨53,000 - ‚Ç¨50,000 = **‚Ç¨3,000**
-   Available at 35% bracket: ‚Ç¨50,000 - ‚Ç¨28,000 = **‚Ç¨22,000**
-   Eligible contribution: ‚Ç¨4,795

**Tax savings breakdown:**

1. First ‚Ç¨3,000 at 43%: ‚Ç¨3,000 √ó 43% = **‚Ç¨1,290**
2. Remaining ‚Ç¨1,795 at 35%: ‚Ç¨1,795 √ó 35% = **‚Ç¨628.25**
3. **Total tax savings: ‚Ç¨1,290 + ‚Ç¨628.25 = ‚Ç¨1,918.25**

**TFR Taxation (Proportional):**

-   Income ‚Ç¨53,000 breakdown:
    -   ‚Ç¨28,000 at 23% = (28,000/53,000) √ó 23% = **12.2%**
    -   ‚Ç¨22,000 at 35% = (22,000/53,000) √ó 35% = **14.5%**
    -   ‚Ç¨3,000 at 43% = (3,000/53,000) √ó 43% = **2.4%**
-   **Proportional rate: 12.2% + 14.5% + 2.4% = 29.1%**

**Monthly Pension Fund Deposits:**

-   Regular contributions: (‚Ç¨1,325 + ‚Ç¨795 + ‚Ç¨4,000) √∑ 12 = **‚Ç¨510/month**
-   TFR: ‚Ç¨3,927.30 √∑ 13 = **‚Ç¨302.10/month** (months 1-11)
-   December: ‚Ç¨510 + (2 √ó ‚Ç¨302.10) = **‚Ç¨1,114.20** (double TFR)
