# üè¶ Retire Right Lab - Italian Pension Fund Calculator

A comprehensive **Next.js** pension fund calculator specifically designed for the Italian market. This tool simulates pension fund investments, TFR (Trattamento di Fine Rapporto), ETF reinvestments, and personal investments with accurate Italian tax calculations.

## üìä What This Calculator Does

This calculator provides detailed projections for retirement planning in Italy, comparing different investment strategies:

-   **Pension Fund (Fondo Pensione)** with TFR conversion
-   **Company TFR** traditional accumulation
-   **ETF Reinvestment** of tax deductions
-   **Personal Investment** alternative

## üßÆ Complete Calculation Methodology

### 1. üìà Monthly Compound Interest Calculations

#### 1.1 Pension Fund with TFR Timing

The pension fund calculation uses **monthly compounding** with special handling for TFR (13-month salary structure):

```typescript
function calculatePensionFundMonthlyCompound(
    currentAccumulated: number,
    yearlyContribution: number,
    yearlyTfr: number,
    annualRate: number
): number {
    const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
    const monthlyContribution = yearlyContribution / 12;
    const monthlyTfrPortion = yearlyTfr / 13; // TFR divided by 13 months

    let accumulated = currentAccumulated;

    // Months 1-11: Regular contributions + monthly TFR portion
    for (let month = 0; month < 11; month++) {
        accumulated =
            accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) +
            monthlyContribution +
            monthlyTfrPortion;
    }

    // Month 12: Regular contribution + DOUBLE TFR portion (12th + 13th month paid together)
    accumulated =
        accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) +
        monthlyContribution +
        2 * monthlyTfrPortion;

    return accumulated;
}
```

**Key Points:**

-   **Regular contributions** (investment + employer + worker): divided by 12 months
-   **TFR**: divided by 13 months, but 12th and 13th portions paid together in December
-   **Monthly formula**: `A(t+1) = A(t) √ó (1 + r/12) + monthly_contribution + tfr_portion`

#### 1.2 ETF and Personal Investment Compounding

Standard monthly compounding for ETF and personal investments:

```typescript
function calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    currentAccumulated: number,
    yearlyContribution: number,
    annualRate: number
): number {
    const monthlyRate = annualRate / 100 / 12;
    const monthlyContribution = yearlyContribution / 12;

    let accumulated = currentAccumulated;

    for (let month = 0; month < 12; month++) {
        accumulated = accumulated * (1 + monthlyRate) + monthlyContribution;
    }

    return accumulated;
}
```

**Formula**: `A(t+1) = A(t) √ó (1 + r/12) + contribution/12`

### 2. üí∞ Contribution Calculations

#### 2.1 Annual Contributions

```typescript
// Employer contribution (only if TFR is calculated)
const employerContribution = params.calculateTfr
    ? currentIncome * (params.employerContribution / 100)
    : 0;

// TFR calculation (7.41% of gross salary)
const tfr = params.calculateTfr ? currentIncome * 0.0741 : 0;

// Member/worker contribution (only if TFR is calculated)
const memberContribution = params.calculateTfr
    ? currentIncome * (params.memberContribution / 100)
    : 0;

// Additional investment (user-defined)
const currentInvestment = params.investment; // Updated yearly based on increases
```

#### 2.2 Income and Investment Growth

```typescript
// Income increases
if (year > 1 && (year - 1) % params.incomeIncrease.frequency === 0) {
    if (params.incomeIncrease.isPercentage) {
        currentIncome *= 1 + params.incomeIncrease.amount / 100;
    } else {
        currentIncome += params.incomeIncrease.amount;
    }
}

// Investment increases (can be negative for inflation adjustments)
if (year > 1 && (year - 1) % params.investmentIncrease.frequency === 0) {
    if (params.investmentIncrease.isPercentage) {
        currentInvestment *= 1 + params.investmentIncrease.amount / 100;
    } else {
        currentInvestment += params.investmentIncrease.amount;
    }
}
```

### 3. üè¶ Tax Calculations

#### 3.1 Fiscal Relaxation (Detrazione Fiscale)

Tax deductions available on personal contributions with income-based brackets:

```typescript
function calculateFiscalRelaxation(
    amount: number,
    previousYearIncome: number
): number {
    let relaxation = 0;
    let remainingAmount = Math.min(amount, 5164.57); // Maximum eligible amount

    if (previousYearIncome > 50000) {
        // 43% rate for income > ‚Ç¨50,000
        const availableAtHighest = previousYearIncome - 50000;
        const amountAtHighest = Math.min(remainingAmount, availableAtHighest);
        relaxation += amountAtHighest * 0.43;
        remainingAmount -= amountAtHighest;

        // 35% rate for ‚Ç¨28,000-‚Ç¨50,000 bracket
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            const amountAtMiddle = Math.min(remainingAmount, 22000);
            relaxation += amountAtMiddle * 0.35;
            remainingAmount -= amountAtMiddle;
        }

        // 23% rate for ‚Ç¨0-‚Ç¨28,000 bracket
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            relaxation += remainingAmount * 0.23;
        }
    } else if (previousYearIncome > 28000) {
        // 35% rate for ‚Ç¨28,000-‚Ç¨50,000
        const availableAtHighest = previousYearIncome - 28000;
        const amountAtHighest = Math.min(remainingAmount, availableAtHighest);
        relaxation += amountAtHighest * 0.35;
        remainingAmount -= amountAtHighest;

        // 23% rate for remaining
        if (remainingAmount > 0) {
            relaxation += remainingAmount * 0.23;
        }
    } else {
        // 23% rate for income ‚â§ ‚Ç¨28,000
        relaxation = remainingAmount * 0.23;
    }

    return relaxation;
}
```

**Tax Brackets:**

-   **23%**: Income ‚Ç¨0 - ‚Ç¨28,000
-   **35%**: Income ‚Ç¨28,001 - ‚Ç¨50,000
-   **43%**: Income > ‚Ç¨50,000

**Important**: Maximum eligible amount for deductions: **‚Ç¨5,164.57**

#### 3.2 Pension Fund Taxation

Progressive taxation based on years of participation:

```typescript
const calculateTaxRate = (years: number): number => {
    if (years <= 15) return 15; // 15% for first 15 years
    if (years >= 35) return 9; // 9% minimum after 35 years
    return 15 - (years - 15) * 0.3; // Decreases 0.3% per year from year 16-35
};
```

**Tax Formula**: `Tax = 15% - 0.3% √ó (years - 15)` for years 16-35

#### 3.3 TFR Taxation

TFR taxation uses proportional taxation based on average of last 5 years:

```typescript
function calculateTfrTaxationRate(
    yearlyResults: YearlyResult[],
    currentYear: number,
    currentIncome: number
): number {
    let totalProportionalTaxation = 0;
    const yearsToConsider = Math.min(currentYear, 5);

    // Calculate proportional tax for each year based on income
    // Then average over the years considered

    return totalProportionalTaxation / yearsToConsider;
}
```

**Proportional Tax Calculation**:

```typescript
// For each income level, calculate weighted average of tax brackets
if (income <= 28000) {
    proportionalTaxation = 23;
} else if (income <= 50000) {
    const bracket1Amount = 28000;
    const bracket2Amount = income - 28000;
    proportionalTaxation =
        (bracket1Amount / income) * 23 + (bracket2Amount / income) * 35;
} else {
    const bracket1Amount = 28000;
    const bracket2Amount = 22000;
    const bracket3Amount = income - 50000;
    proportionalTaxation =
        (bracket1Amount / income) * 23 +
        (bracket2Amount / income) * 35 +
        (bracket3Amount / income) * 43;
}
```

### 4. üè¢ TFR Company Calculation

TFR accumulation in company with annual revaluation:

```typescript
// TFR revaluation rate: 1.5% fixed + 75% of inflation
const tfrRevaluationRate = 1.5 + 0.75 * params.inflation;

// Annual TFR accumulation with revaluation
tfrGrossAccumulated =
    tfrGrossAccumulated * (1 + tfrRevaluationRate / 100) +
    tfr * (1 + tfrRevaluationRate / 100);

// Apply taxation
const tfrNetValue = tfrGrossAccumulated * (1 - tfrTaxationRate / 100);
```

**Formula**: `TFR(t+1) = TFR(t) √ó (1 + revaluation_rate) + current_year_tfr √ó (1 + revaluation_rate)`

### 5. üìä ETF Reinvestment Strategy

ETF reinvestment uses tax savings from fiscal relaxation:

```typescript
// ETF investment equals total fiscal relaxation
const etfInvestment = params.etfReinvestment.enabled
    ? totalFiscalRelaxation
    : 0;

// Calculate ETF accumulation with monthly compounding
etfAccumulatedValue = calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    etfAccumulatedValue,
    etfInvestment,
    params.etfReinvestment.annualReturn
);

// Tax only on gains (not contributions)
const etfGains = Math.max(0, etfAccumulatedValue - totalEtfContributions);
const etfTaxOnGains = etfGains * (params.etfReinvestment.taxRate / 100);
const etfNetAccumulatedValue = etfAccumulatedValue - etfTaxOnGains;
```

### 6. üéØ Personal Investment Alternative

Personal investment after IRPEF taxation:

```typescript
// Total personal contributions subject to IRPEF
const totalPersonalContributions = memberContribution + currentInvestment;

// Calculate IRPEF tax on contributions
const irpefTaxOnPersonalContributions = calculateIrpefTax(
    totalPersonalContributions,
    currentIncome
);

// Net investment amount after IRPEF
const personalInvestmentAmount =
    totalPersonalContributions - irpefTaxOnPersonalContributions;

// Calculate accumulation, then tax only gains
personalAccumulatedValue = calculateETFMonthlyCompound(
    personalAccumulatedValue,
    personalInvestmentAmount,
    params.personalInvestment.annualReturn
);

// Tax only on gains (capital gains tax)
const totalGains = Math.max(
    0,
    personalAccumulatedValue - totalPersonalInvestments
);
const totalTaxOnGains = totalGains * (params.personalInvestment.taxRate / 100);
personalNetAccumulatedValue = personalAccumulatedValue - totalTaxOnGains;
```

### 7. üíπ Inflation Adjustment (Real Values)

All calculations include inflation-adjusted "real values":

```typescript
// Real value calculation
const realValue = nominalValue / Math.pow(1 + params.inflation / 100, year);

// Net real value (after tax and inflation)
const netRealValue = netValue / Math.pow(1 + params.inflation / 100, year);
```

**Formula**: `Real Value = Nominal Value / (1 + inflation)^years`

### 8. üìà Return Calculations

#### Annualized Returns

```typescript
// Gross annualized return
const annualizedReturn =
    Math.pow(finalValue / totalContributions, 1 / params.duration) - 1;

// Net annualized return (after taxes)
const netAnnualizedReturn =
    Math.pow(netFinalValue / totalContributions, 1 / params.duration) - 1;
```

**Formula**: `Annualized Return = (Final Value / Initial Investment)^(1/years) - 1`

## üîç Key Features & Assumptions

### Monthly vs Annual Contributions

-   **Pension Fund**: Monthly contributions with special TFR timing (13-month structure)
-   **ETF/Personal**: Standard 12-month equal contributions
-   **Compounding**: Applied monthly for more accurate projections

### Tax Timing

-   **Fiscal Relaxation**: Applied in year N+1 based on year N contributions and income
-   **Pension Fund Tax**: Applied at withdrawal (simulated annually)
-   **ETF/Personal Tax**: Only on gains, not contributions

### Italian Specifics

-   **TFR Rate**: 7.41% of gross salary
-   **TFR Revaluation**: 1.5% + 75% of inflation
-   **13th Month**: Paid in December with regular December salary
-   **Tax Brackets**: Accurate Italian IRPEF brackets (23%, 35%, 43%)
